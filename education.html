        <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/subjects/chemistry/">BS in Chemistry</a> for 3 years. 
        During my time studing Chemistry (along with Physics and maths) i devalouped an intrest in algorithims 
        and cryptogrophy. So after graduating once i decided to go back and study towards a <a href=
